# Description

The Barcelona Kernel Peer Lab is an open community for all enthusiasts of the Linux Kernel and other low level software and hardware projects which may be of interest.

A Peer Lab is a meeting of developers who want to work on a specific project. In our case that will be the mainline Linux Kernel. It can be that everybody has it's own little project he wants to work on. It can be that you find someone else to work together on a specific project, or you don't have a project but you are interested to start contributing to the kernel.

It aims at finding ways for enthusiasts to meet through physical (meetups) and virtual channels (IRC, ML, etc.).
